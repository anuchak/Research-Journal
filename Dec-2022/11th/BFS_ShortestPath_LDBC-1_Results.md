# LDBC 1

The results of each query have been arranged as follows:
- The shortest hop path (starting from destination node ID to the source node ID)
- The highest execution time taken out of 5 runs
- The lowest execution time taken out of 5 runs

For the Neo4j queries, total time taken is specified after the _completed after_ part.  
Two executions with the highest and lowest time taken.  

Shortest Path format:
Dest Node | `Rel ID` | Next Node | `Rel ID` | ... | Source Node
